    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Data Engineer with over 5 years of experience in building and maintaining end-to-end ETL pipelines across cloud and on-premise environments. I specialize in designing scalable, reliable, and high-performance data workflows for both batch and streaming data using tools like Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory, and Google Cloud Dataflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      My core expertise includes Python programming (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, data modeling, and cloud data warehouses like BigQuery and Snowflake. I also bring strong experience in query optimization for both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Cosmos DB.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about building high-quality data solutions that are robust, maintainable, and transparent. I have worked closely with analysts, data scientists, and business stakeholders to deliver model-ready datasets and data products that support advanced analytics and AI/ML initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to continuous improvement and clear documentation. With a keen eye for data quality, I implement validations, exception handling, and automated monitoring across data pipelines.
